* Thesis Questions
** is requiring a singular solution a characteristic of the indirect approach or does it apply to the direct approach as well?

* Correction to the python automation script
correct the follwing
  - createPSet_edge(modelName, partName[1], 'mbaseEdge_3', 0.0, *-pileDia/4.0*, domainDepth)
  - correct the boundary conditions for *baseEdge_4* and *baseEdge_5* from *YSYMM* to *Fixed*
  - correct the boundary conditions for *mbaseEdge_4* and *mbaseEdge_5* from *YSYMM* to *Fixed*
  - *mfrontFace_5* and *mfrontFace_6* apply *YSYMM*
  - *mfrontEdge_2* apply *YSYMM*
* Boundary Sensitivity Study
range of lateral boundary considered are

| model name | boundary distance          |
|------------+----------------------------|
|        nil | \(2.0L\)                   |
|          2 | \(1.0L\)                   |
|          3 | \(0.5L\)                   |
|          4 | \(0.25L\)                  |
