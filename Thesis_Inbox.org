SCHEDULED: <2022-11-09 Wed>
*** DONE Revise the literature review section of synthesis and Worku's work [5/5]
SCHEDULED: <2022-11-10 Thu 08:00-10:00>
    - [X] review other synthesis works
    - [X] add notes on how the 2010 model was developed

    - [X] review the 2013 and 2014 models
    - [X] why is the 2014 model better
*** DONE Add radius to Boundsens plot
SCHEDULED: <2022-11-14 Mon>
    - add \(r = 0.25\) for \(\frac{L}{r} = 80\) and
    - add \(r = 0.50\) for \(\frac{L}{r} = 40\)


* Thesis Questions
** is requiring a singular solution a characteristic of the indirect approach or does it apply to the direct approach as well?
** could it be possible to create a a worku(2010) variant that accounts for lateral variation of soil and use that in analysis of laterally loaded piles.

* Correction to the python automation script
correct the follwing
  - createPSet_edge(modelName, partName[1], 'mbaseEdge_3', 0.0, *-pileDia/4.0*, domainDepth)
  - correct the boundary conditions for *baseEdge_4* and *baseEdge_5* from *YSYMM* to *Fixed*
  - correct the boundary conditions for *mbaseEdge_4* and *mbaseEdge_5* from *YSYMM* to *Fixed*
  - *mfrontFace_5* and *mfrontFace_6* apply *YSYMM*
  - *mfrontEdge_2* apply *YSYMM*
* Boundary Sensitivity Study
range of lateral boundary considered are

| model name | boundary distance          |
|------------+----------------------------|
|        nil | \(2.0L\)                   |
|          2 | \(1.0L\)                   |
|          3 | \(0.5L\)                   |
|          4 | \(0.25L\)                  |
|          5 | min 30.0m (used in thesis) |

an example to show abel.
